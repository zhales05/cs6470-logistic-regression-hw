In this assignment, you will implement a logistic regression model from scratch for binary classification.

You will use the Wine dataset from sklearn.datasets but focus only on classes 0 and 1. After implementing your logistic regression, you will compare its performance with the default LogisticRegression model from scikit-learn.

Instructions:
Move Base Model File: 

Create an abstract base class Model using Pythonâ€™s abc module with the following abstract methods:
fit(X, y): Train the model on input features X and target y.
predict(X): Predict class labels for input features X.
cost_function(X, y): Compute the cost (e.g., log-loss) for the current model parameters.
You may define this class within your Jupyter Notebook or Python script; no separate file is required.
Create a New Class for Logistic Regression: [20 pt]

Implement logistic regression by extending the Model class from.
The logistic regression model should:
Fit the model parameters.
Predict class labels based on the sigmoid function.
Evaluate performance using Confusion matrix, Accuracy,  Precision, Recall, and ROC curve
Dataset: 

Use the load_wine() dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Select only the classes 0 and 1 for binary classification.
Compare with sklearn Logistic Regression: [5pt]

After implementing your logistic regression model, compare its performance with the default LogisticRegression from scikit-learn.
Perform the following comparisons: Confusion matrix, Accuracy,  Precision, Recall, and ROC curve
Report: [5 pt]

Submit your implementation in a Jupyter notebook.
There is no need to submit a separate report file (e.g., .docx, .pdf) if the notebook contains all results, code, and comparisons.
Report should contain your findings.
